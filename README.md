# Java Calculator

This calculator application was my first Java project, developed during my high school years. It represents my initial journey into Java programming and GUI development using Swing.

## Project Overview

This is a fully functional calculator with a graphical user interface built using Java Swing. The project was developed as part of my high school coursework and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including event handling, GUI design, and basic arithmetic operations.

### Features

- Basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (ร)
  - Division (รท)
  - Power/Exponent (^)
- Additional functionality:
  - Decimal point support
  - Clear function (AC)
  - User-friendly GUI interface
  - Error handling for invalid operations

### Technical Details

- **Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: Java Swing
- **Build Tool**: Java Compiler
- **Development Environment**: NetBeans IDE

## Running the Application

There are two ways to run this calculator:

### Method 1: Using NetBeans IDE
1. Open NetBeans IDE
2. File -> Open Project -> Select the project folder
3. Right-click on the project in the Project Explorer
4. Click "Run" or press F6

### Method 2: Using Command Line
1. Make sure you have Java JDK installed (Java 16 or later)
2. Open terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p target/classes
   javac -d target/classes src/main/java/com/mycompany/calculatorj/Calculator.java
   ```
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java -cp target/classes com.mycompany.calculatorj.Calculator
   ```

## Project Structure

The main components of the project include:
- `Calculator.java`: Contains the main logic and GUI implementation
- `Calculator.form`: NetBeans form file for the GUI layout
- `pom.xml`: Maven project configuration file

## Personal Note

This calculator project holds special significance as it was my first Java application, developed during my high school years. It represents my initial steps into the world of programming and GUI development. While the code might not reflect current best practices, it serves as a milestone in my programming journey and demonstrates my early understanding of:

- Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Event-driven programming
- GUI development
- Basic error handling
- User input processing
